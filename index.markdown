I began work on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at SNHU in
October 2021. I received my associate degree in January of 2023 and
finished coursework for my bachelor’s degree in June of 2024.

Throughout my studies, I have developed an invaluable set of skills,
principles, and attitudes that will let me fulfill my professional
aspirations with confidence and purpose. My knowledge, creativity, and
drive make me a great fit for virtually any development or analytical
role. I can work on my own, efficiently managing time, deadlines and
results, or as part of a team in both contributing and leadership roles.
In addition to understanding how to best take advantage of the benefits
provided by computers, I also know the importance of a strong work
ethic, professional discipline, effective communication, and the ability
to efficiently manage projects large and small.

## Collaborating In A Team Environment
![Teamwork](/assets/teamwork-small.jpg)

Thanks to courses such as CS-250, Software Development Lifecycle, I am
familiar with both waterfall and agile project management methodologies
and understand how to leverage both approaches to achieve the best
results for a given project. I am also aware that for any team project,
clear and open communication is a must. The team functions better than
the sum of its parts when individuals work to keep each other updated
and “in the loop” as the development process plays out.

## Communication With Stakeholders
![Communication](/assets/communication-small.jpg)

Several courses including project management, data analysis, and
statistics helped me develop the skills necessary to communicate
complicated ideas to different types of audiences. While fellow team
members might want detailed explanations of the processes you go
through, managers in need of information to make decisions won’t be as
interested in the inner workings of a statistical analysis as they will
be in the analysis results. I understand that I will often need to
change my communication methods depending on who I am speaking to and
what they want (and I have the skills to do so effectively).

## Data Structures And Algorithms
![Data](/assets/data-small.jpg)

Courses such as CS-300, Data Structure Analysis and Design have given me
a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. As part of the
projects completed for the course, I conducted a detailed analysis of
various data structures including vector storage, hash tables, and
binary search trees. I was also tasked with creating search and sort
algorithms, and finally, comparing the performance of various
combinations to determine the best solution for a hypothetical use case.

## Software Engineering And Databases
![Software](/assets/software-small.jpg)

Data analysis is an area of computer science that I am especially
interested in. I have taken several extra elective courses dealing with
statistics, data analytics methods, and machine learning. Of course, a
large portion of my classes also involved programming in one form or
another. I prefer writing code in Python and Java, but I am proficient
in other languages including C++ and R as well.

I am also comfortable with several different development environments. I
have worked on projects for both Windows and Linux with command line and
graphical interfaces, using IDEs such as Eclipse, VSCode, Visual Studio,
Codeblocks, and Jupyter Notebooks.

Various data courses have fed my knowledge of both SQL and NoSQL
databases. I have put together and worked with implementations of
MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I understand the pros and cons of both
types of systems and how to get the most out of each.

Various course projects have covered everything from simple database and
table creation to a full stack single-page web application using the
MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js). I thoroughly
enjoy the process of seeing results materialize from the code I have
written.

In addition to developing software for different users and purposes, I
also understand the importance of thorough testing. I am quite capable
of writing unit tests that help ensure all my code is not just
functional but produces the intended results consistently and reliably.

## Security
![Security](/assets/security-small.jpg)

Security is, of course, a core principle in any type of computer science
role. From software development to data storage and analysis, it is the
responsibility of everyone in the field to do their best to maintain the
security of systems and sensitive information. During my studies at SNHU
I have developed an ingrained security-conscious mindset. No matter if I
am working on code or searching for something in a database, I am always
careful to make sure that I am not creating (and indeed preventing)
security holes.

I fully believe in the concept that no user should have access to
anything more than what they absolutely need to carry out their job.
Access levels should be consistently monitored and managed and entry
points should be routinely tested for weaknesses or breaches.

# The Capstone Project

The bachelor program capstone project involved the enhancement of one or
more artifacts from past classes of the student's choice in three key
areas:

- Software design and engineering

- Algorithms and data structures

- Databases

## Starting Point Artifact
![Starting Point](/assets/starting-small.jpg)

I chose to start with the course project from one of my first-year
courses, IT-145: Foundations in Application Development. Throughout the
course, students were guided through creating a basic Java application
with a command line interface and simple menu system.

The hypothetical use case for the application is a rescue animal
organization that provides animals to assist people with disabilities
such as a blind person, or someone confined to a wheelchair. The
application is basically an inventory management program used to keep
track of various characteristics of the animals in use by the
organization.

As is, the application works only in memory with a small amount of
demonstration data generated within the code. No database interface
exists and there is no persistent storage. Although it is functional,
the program serves only as a very basic indication that the student
understands simple concepts of object-oriented programming and common
constructs such as variables, classes, lists, and loops.

I’ve included an analysis of the original Java code base and
functionality of the program in a short [informal code review
video](/assets/CodeReview.mp4).

## Enhancement Goals
![Goals](/assets/goals-small.jpg)
I chose to use this single artifact to meet all of the required
enhancement goals for the capstone project. My goal was to convert the
original Java application into a fully functional Python-based web
application that could be put to real use. The finished product was
developed using the Flask web application framework and the Bulma CSS
framework.

Although a virtually infinite number of tweaks and changes could be made
to tailor the program for more specific use cases, it is an example of a
working application that could be used in a real-world, multi-user
environment to allow both local and distributed teams to manage rescue
animal inventory in real-time.

In addition to making artifact enhancements in specific categories, the
capstone project goals also include practical demonstration of several
expected course outcomes:

1.  Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that
    enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making
    in the field of computer science.

2.  Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and
    visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and
    appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.

3.  Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem
    using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and
    standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs
    involved in design choices.

4.  Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative
    techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose
    of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish
    industry-specific goals.

5.  Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in
    software architecture and designs to expose potential
    vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and
    enhanced security of data and resources.

A side-by-side comparison of the original artifact and the finished
enhanced artifact can be found in the main branch of my [CS-499
repository](https://github.com/jtm-snhu/CS-499). The original, functional artifact is stored in the app-java
folder and the enhanced version is stored in the app-python folder.

## Enhancement 1: Software Design & Engineering
![Software](/assets/software2-small.jpg)
The final product barely resembles the original artifact. It was
completely rewritten from scratch in Python. The simple numeric menu
system is replaced by an intuitive web interface that allows the user to
list, filter, and edit items. Multiple filters can be applied to search
and sort operations, allowing for granular control over the returned
results.

The interface navigation buttons displayed on the top-right corner of
the screen also change to reflect only the operations to which the user
has access. Authenticated users, for example, will see a logout button
while unauthenticated users will be presented with login and signup
buttons. Forms and fields are also tailored to incorporate
characteristics specific enough to be used for managing animals, but
general enough to allow the flexibility of storing meaningful data for
multiple types of animals.

Whereas the original application was designed to run as a single
instance on a single computer, the new application can be hosted on a
central server and accessed via browser by anyone, anywhere. It can be
used by individuals in the same office or in different countries. No
matter where they are, anyone using the application will see inventory
updates in real-time.

In addition to the enhancements made to pre-existing functions from the
original application, this new application also provides several layers
of security. The most obvious change is that the application requires
users to sign up and login before they can carry out any operations.
“Under the hood”, however, the system generates CSRF security tokens and
validates all form input data to prevent cross site request forgery.
User passwords are also hashed and stored in the database in an
encrypted form so that even with physical access to the database,
passwords cannot be read.

These factors demonstrate course outcomes 1, 3, 4, and 5 listed above.

I have also included a [brief narrative](/narrative1) of my thoughts
written as I was working on this enhancement.

The source code for this stage of the enhancement can be viewed in the
[revision2 branch](https://github.com/jtm-snhu/CS-499/tree/revision2) of the repository.

## Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
![Algorithms](/assets/algorithms-small.jpg)
For this enhancement, I added functions to the base code that gauge
performance of three different sort algorithms by generating a list of
100,000 animal objects, randomizing that list, and finally sorting into
ascending order based on the ID of each object.

The internal Python Tim sort function is used along with custom pivot
and merge sort algorithms. To test each algorithm, 100k animal objects
are generated in a standard Python list. That list is then shuffled into
a random order. At that point, a copy of the list is made for each
sorting algorithm to work on, ensuring that each algorithm starts with
the same data. A timing function is then used to measure how much time
it takes for each sort method to put the list back into ascending order.

As you might have guessed, the Tim sort method used by Python
outperforms the others by a significant amount.

This portion of the enhancements demonstrates course outcome 3, listed
above.

I have also included a [brief narrative](/narrative2) of my thoughts
that was written as I was working on this enhancement.

The source code for this stage of the enhancement can be viewed in the
[revision3 branch](https://github.com/jtm-snhu/CS-499/tree/revision3) of the repository.

## Enhancement 3: Databases
![Databases](/assets/databases-small.jpg)
The most obvious evidence of meeting the requirements for the third
category enhancement is that the application now uses a database for
persistent storage of information. As it is, the application uses SQLite
to store both user and animal inventory information. A trivial change in
the code can also be made to use another SQL database platform such as
MySQL or PostgreSQL.

The application provides full CRUD capabilities, allowing users to add,
edit, and delete animals and create users authorized to access the
application.

In addition to providing information storage, the fully implemented
database functionality also serves as part of the system’s security
measures by allowing for the authentication of users and storing all
user passwords in an encrypted form.

This portion of the enhancements demonstrates course outcomes 3, 4, and
5 listed above.

I have also included a [brief narrative](/narrative3) of my thoughts
that was written as I was working on this enhancement.

The source code for this stage of the enhancement can be viewed in the
[revision4 branch](https://github.com/jtm-snhu/CS-499/tree/revision4) of the repository, which was ultimately merged into the
main branch.
